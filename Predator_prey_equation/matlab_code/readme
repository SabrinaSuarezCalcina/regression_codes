This folder contains the code that calculates the regression directly using the matrices of the solutions of the predator-prey equation,
that is, without calculating persistent homology.
First, you need to go to the Matrix folder, there you will find the link that contains the path to the matrices of the Predator-prey equation.
So just run the code!!!
