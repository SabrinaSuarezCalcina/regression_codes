# regression_codes
Welcome to my repository: "regression_codes". This repository is organized in 2 folders: "Predator_prey_equation" and "Ginzburg_Landau_equation". Below we present the description of each folder.
 
 
 **Ginzburg_Landau_equation** This folder is organized in 8 folders:
    
   **Figures** : "Regression_beta_feature_10_50_ginzburg_vectorization.pdf", "Regression_beta_feature_3_20_ginzburg_vectorization_7train_10test.pdf" and "Regression_beta_feature_3_20_ginzburg_new_vectorization_7train_10test.pdf" show average R^2 values with RMSE error bars as a function of the parameter m for KNeighbors and SVR regressor for the Ginzburg-Landau equation using the vectorization proposed (binning approach) where the first figure shows all values of β were used for training and testing, the second figure shows the 5 values of the parameter β ∈ {0.1, 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, 4.2} were using for training and the data corresponding to the values of β ∈ {1.2, 1.8} were used only for testing after the model was validated, and the last figure uses the persistence density feature vector where the 5 values of the parameter β ∈ {0.1, 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, 4.2} were using for training and the data corresponding to the values of β ∈ {1.2, 1.8} were used only for testing after the model was validated.
